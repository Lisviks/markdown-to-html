# This is a heading

And this would be just a normal paragraph. Now let's see how to open this file with GO and change it to HTML.

This another paragraph with a link to [GitHub](https://github.com). Which should be converted somehow to HTML from markdown.

Also there is some text with inline code `num := 1` in the middle of the text.

```
// This is a code block
func sum(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}
```

Some _italic_ and __bold__ and then some *__italic bold__*
